#IPL 2022 Analysis

#Introduction

This project analyzes various aspects of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 season using Python. The dataset includes match details, player statistics, and outcomes from the season. By leveraging data visualization libraries such as Plotly, we aim to uncover insights into team performance, individual achievements, and match outcomes.

#Methodology

#Data Preparation

**Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded using Pandas from a CSV file located at C:\Users\King\Desktop\matches.csv.

**Data Cleaning**: Mapping Values: The column won_by was mapped to categorize outcomes into 'Chasing' or 'Defending' based on whether the match was won by wickets or runs.

#Visualization

#Bar Chart: Number of Matches Won by Each Team

**Purpose**: To visualize the frequency of matches won by each team.
**Method**: Used Plotly Express to create a bar chart with match_winner as the x-axis.

#Pie Chart: Matches Won by Chasing vs. Defending

**Purpose**: To show the proportion of matches won by chasing or defending.
**Method**: Used Plotly Graph Objects to create a pie chart with won_by values categorized and colored for better visibility.

#Bar Chart: Best Bowlers
